### Who am I:

Hi! :) I am a student from Saint-Petersburg, Russia. I study at ITMO university, but, actually,
I learn a lot for myself in the spare time. I started this blog in hope to organize my life, in hope to help somebody.

### My passions:

1. Programming
  * I am really passionated about Linux OS, Bash and Java. I love to test my willpower and perseverance, and programming, with
  all the bugs hunt, compatibility problems and a tonn of technologies, is perfectly suited for me. I don't really like to develop Enterprice software,
  so my biggest dream is to get a job in some kind of linux oriented software development which will be used by another programmers.
2. Piano
  * I am self-educated pianist, and i am really inspired by two composers: Ludovico Einaudi and Ilya Beshevli. I like to pick up some songs from time to time,
  and make a Synthesia-versions of them. You can check out my YouTube channel for free tabs: {Channel is in development right now}
3. My family
  * Can't say a lot here, but my family is the one of my true reasons to live. Thx for all the help, guys, i love you. ^)
