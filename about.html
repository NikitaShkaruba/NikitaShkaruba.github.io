  <h2 class="green">about{me}</h2>
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I am a student from Saint-Petersburg, Russia. I study at ITMO university and learning a lot for myself in the spare time.</p>

<p>I truly love 3 things in life. They are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Programming</dt>
    <dd>I am really passionated about Linux OS, Bash and Java. I do like to test my willpower and perseverance, so, actually, programming with
      all the bugs hunt, compatibility problems and a tonn of technologies is perfectly suited for me. I don't really like developing Enterprice software,
      so my biggest dream is to get a job in some kind of linux oriented software development which will be used by another programmers.
    </dd>
  <dt>Piano</dt>
    <dd>I am self-educated pianist, and i am really inspired by two composers: Ludovico Einaudi and Ilya Beshevli. I pick up some songs from time to time,
      actually and making a Synthesia-versions of them. You can check out my YouTube channel for free tabs: {Channel is in evelopment right now}</dd>
  <dt>My family</dt>
    <dd>Can't say a lot here, but my family is kind of my true reasons to live. Thx for all the help, guys, i love you. ^)</dd>
