It is finally done! I finally made a blog. If I didn't know myself, I would instantly ask: "But why, Nick?" And that's the question for this post.

#### Why do I need a blog:
  * Structuring information in my head. It's because when you're teaching someone, you learn a lot too.
  * Quality learning. It's because I feel a responsible for your time, and I'll try my best
  * English and Russian writing practice. I do write a blog in two languages
  * Another point in my resume. It's really hard to know potential employee only for interview hours, blog will help.
  * Self-expression, because I am only human, it's my natural need.
  * Advertising, if I'll be maintaining quality posts.

#### Things I'll be writing about:
  * [code{java}](/code/) Posts about programming languages, their inner structure, their capabilities
  * [software{linux}](/software/) Posts about system software, which can ease your life
  * [life{me}](/life/) Posts about my ideology in my early 19 years, my thoughts about the world around

#### Foreword:
I'll be writing constantly, because right now I have a lot of important things, which I do want to share with the world.
I'll be writing every week, at Sunday.
I'll to post only quality content, and if I'll feel that I am producing crap, I'll stop, I swear.
I asked for my secret editor's help for a first time.

My next post will be about my experience with Vim.
See you. And stay awesome, my reader!
