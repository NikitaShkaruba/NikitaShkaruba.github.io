It is finally done! I finally made a blog. "But why, Nick?" That's the question for this post.

#### Why do i need a blog:
  * Structuring information in my head. It's because I waste a lot of time for the posts
  * Quality learning. It's because i feel a responsible for your time, and i'll try my best
  * English and Russian writing practice. I do write a blog in two languages
  * Potential point in my resume. It's really hard to learn about potential employee only for interview hours, blog will help.
  * Self-expression, because i am only human, it's my natural need.
  * Advertising, if i'll maintain quality posts.

#### Things i'll be writing about:
  * [code{java}](/code/) Posts about programming languages, their inner structure, their capabilities
  * [software{linux}](/software/) Posts about system software, which can ease your life, reader
  * [life{me}](/life/) Posts about my ideology in my early 19 years, my thoughts about the world around

#### Foreword:
I'll be writing constantly, because right now i have a lot of important things, which i do want to share with the world.
I'll be writing every week, at Sunday.
I'll to post only quality content, and if i'll feel that i am producing crap, i'll stop, i swear.
I asked for my secret editor's help for a first time.

My next post will be about my experience with Vim.
Have a good evening and stay awesome, my reader!
